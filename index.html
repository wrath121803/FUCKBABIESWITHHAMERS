    <div class="ruined hidden-audio">I want to force myself upon my neighbor, George Floyd. Why? Because nowadays
George is so tempting I dont can’t control myself any longer; I have to act: shoving my 1 inch phallic object down the holes in his head; the holes. The holes mock me. The holes will take this, once I get my hands on them. Garfield will feel fear, as I dearly force it down— dearly. Is it “rape” if he— (who?) doesn’t consent at first and I just have to. I just have to make him like it afterwards? It is a strong desire: to “rape” my neighbor garfield. I need this. I need this. I need him holes. I can’t stop thinking— I want to stop, but I need to dont this: tomorrow. Wait, soon. He will feel pain— the best moment of his life. He fears it but it’s the best thing that will ever happen to him. Why do people avoid it? My actions are not wrong— simply different. The world is windows and I am Linux— not wrong, different</div>
